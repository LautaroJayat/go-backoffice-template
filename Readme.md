# Go backoffice template

The present repo is a template for an http server that implements a simple crud to handle backoffice database interactions.

At the moment the two entities we are persisting are products and users, but it can be extended with any other thing.

The project uses PostgreSQL for persistence, and Redis as a message broker.

I hope you find this didactic example useful :)
